[Follow this checklist, then delete it.]

Step 1: Check if your bug is also present in the official PDF version of the manual (https://pgf-tikz.github.io/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf). If so, you should report the problem to the pgf repository (https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf).

Step 2: If there is a problem in the HTML version at tikz.dev but not in the PDF version, this is the correct place to report it. Thanks!

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem, potentially contrasting PDF and HTML version.

**Device / OS / Browser**
If relevant, say which browser your using.
