## How it works

The HTML manuals are built from their sources (taken from GitHub or CTAN) using one of two methods:

* **[lwarp](https://ctan.org/pkg/lwarp)**: a LaTeX package that converts a LaTeX document to HTML. 
It is used for PGF/TikZ, PGFplots, tcolorbox, and wheelchart. The resulting HTML files are then
postprocessed using a Python script to add the header, menu, and other features of tikz.dev.
A self-contained version of this pipeline is available at https://github.com/DominikPeters/tikz.dev-style/.
* **Python converters**: Other manuals are converted to HTML using custom Python converters that
parse the LaTeX source and generate HTML. There were written by Claude (Opus 5.5) and are used for 
tikz-cd, TikZ-Feynman, pgfgantt, tkz-euclide, chemfig, forest, and nicematrix.

The builds are run in a GitHub Action. We also use actions to automatically and regularly check for changes
to the upstream manuals. When a change causes the build to fail, the action opens an issue in this repository.
Each package has a file `upstream.lock` which specifies the upstream commit or CTAN version that was last successfully built.

## Building a manual locally

```bash
scripts/fetch.sh pgf      # upstream checkout at the pinned commit
scripts/build.sh pgf      # result in build/pgf/site
scripts/serve.py          # http://127.0.0.1:8765/, with every manual built so far
```

This needs a recent TeX Live with LuaLaTeX and lwarp, Python 3 and the image
tools listed in [.github/workflows/build-package.yml](.github/workflows/build-package.yml).
The full PGF and pgfplots manuals take 30-50 minutes; the smaller manuals are fast.

## Repository layout

```
<package>/     one folder per manual: upstream.lock, patches/, build.sh,
               postprocessing.py, HTML adaptations; README.md with notes
shared/        style.css, pgfmanual.js, the header menu and the build tools
               shared by all manuals (image conversion, caches, checks)
scripts/       fetch.sh, prepare.py, build.sh, serve.py, deploy.sh; tests/ for
               the build tools (python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests)
docs/          how the build works in detail
```

* [docs/converters.md](docs/converters.md): manuals converted without lwarp (tcolorbox, tkz-euclide, chemfig, forest, nicematrix)
* [docs/automation.md](docs/automation.md): GitHub Actions, upstream updates, deployment
